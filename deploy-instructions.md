# Deploy Dictionary App to GitHub Pages

## Step-by-Step Deployment Guide

### 1. Create GitHub Repository
1. Go to GitHub.com and create a new repository
2. Name it `dictionary-app` (or any name you prefer)
3. Make it **Public** (GitHub Pages requires public repos for free accounts)
4. Don't initialize with README, .gitignore, or license

### 2. Push Your Code from Replit
In your Replit shell, run these commands:

```bash
# Initialize git (if not already done)
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Commit your changes
git commit -m "Dictionary PWA with Android support"

# Set main branch
git branch -M main

# Add your GitHub repository (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/dictionary-app.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

### 3. GitHub will automatically deploy
The GitHub Action I created will automatically:
- Install dependencies
- Build the project for GitHub Pages
- Deploy to the `gh-pages` branch
- Make it available at `https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/dictionary-app/`

### 4. Enable GitHub Pages (if needed)
1. Go to your repository settings
2. Scroll to "Pages" section
3. Under "Source", select "GitHub Actions"
4. Your app will be live in a few minutes!

### 5. Install on Android
Once deployed:
1. Open the GitHub Pages URL on your Android device
2. Look for the install banner
3. Tap "Install" to add to home screen
4. Enjoy your native-like Android dictionary app!
